<h1>Intellectual Aspect of Neplehsa</h1>
<p>We have a monotheistic religion which encourages the citizens of Neplesha to follow the laws
of the city. It also encourages good ethics for the people which helps and teaches them to follow
the laws put in place by the council or the king. With the religio teaching the people good ethics
and the do's and don'ts of the town, the citizens can live in peace with no conflict being present. Along with
the religion to keep Nepleshan life peaceful, we have a strong military force to defend the city from foreign attacks
and from foreign invaders. </p>

<h2>Education & The study of Math and Science</h2>
<p>Math is not as important to the people. This also goes for philosophy. Despite this, math is
the second most important subject for the people to learn because there is a society that is heavily
focused on making peace or the conquering of other foreign nations.
