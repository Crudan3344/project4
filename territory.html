<h1> Imperial Territorial Briefing </h1>
<h2> Notice: The imperial army is a complete force for good. Any information regarding the unfortunate obliteration of Alderaan is not (and will not)be withheld from our sympathizers. As to be the honest empire, all information shall 
be released once gained. Thank you. </h2>

<h3>Endor<h3> 
<p>Once conquered, this small forested overgrown moon seemed well enough for the Death Star's shield generator to inhabit.
 This however was not the ONLY planet/moon location holding a shield generator. 
 If one seeks to find the others, they are asking for trouble, as those planets (whom shall not be named) are heavily guarded by imperials from all throughout the star systems. 
 This planet is also home to the Ewoks, (Little furry guys who roam the treetops using tree forts built high.) 
 These guys are usually non-threatening, but will act on defense if provoked. Currently, the Ewoks are burrowing in their underground dens for the winter. 
 Also, they don't seem to mind the presence of the Storm Troopers. </p>

 <center><h4>Ziost</h4>
<p> This is the most versatile of planets. With water occupying the southern pole of the planet, the land takes what is left. As an unsettled planet, there are animals (land and sea) occupying it. This 
Planet is put into our planetary records not because we have counquered it but because we have yet to do so. The land portion of the planet consists mainly of deserts with tiny spots of water puddles here and there, 
while the oceanic portion of the planet is occuppied by underwater plants such as coral and seaweed. (sources say that the imperials plan on making an underwater base.)

<p>This planet is home to an ancient peoples unknown to mankind (or any race in the galaxy.) This is because the society that 
had once inhabited this planet are now long gone, leaving the tall-standing relics of their ancient society. Now owned by the Empire (after winning
in a struggle of tug-o-war) against the resistance, the surface and the temples now serve as terranite mines used to build the ships nessecary to 
retake control of the Galaxies and snuffing out the flame of rebellion. </p>

<h5>These aren't the only planets owned by the empire. There are many more. The data files that would need to be archived exceed the capacity 
of storage this database has to offer.</h5>
