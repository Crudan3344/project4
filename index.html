<h1> Welcome Note</h1>
<p>Welcome all to the Empire portal. Here you can explore The many properties of the Empire that will surely bring the Rebels to its knees. We, the Galactic Empire, strive to bring peace and order throughout the galaxy. But we can't do this without YOU!</p>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>Through sheer force and a powerful will to fight, we can achieve this, because the Rebels will never go down without a fight. To achieve peace, this results as our last and only choice left. Joining the empire includes tons of rewards and can also help you better yourself (no matter what race you are.) And so by joining our empire we can give you a place among the highest ranks of the imperial army (beginning from the bottom.) Through many badges and rewards to be earned, you can rise above the highest ranks with strength and hard work. The former republic did nothing to serve the people, as they only cared for themselves. This shows greatly through what happened to the Republic. It fell due to it's own internal issues. And here we are now, rising from the ashes as a new singular and more powerful empire. Big enough to manage the universe. Strong enough to wipe out the Rebellion. Welcome...to the empire, my friend. The rebels are terrorists. They fight so hard to take away the life you people really desire. They are the very reason you seek to join us. 
They have destroyed our ships. Our base. The fall of the corrupt jedi will be the ascension of peace throughout the galaxy. Below the picture(s) are the links to further explore the cause of the emipre. </p>
