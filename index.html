<h1>Welcome to Neplesha</h1>
<p>Welcome to the neplesha society. Surrounded by a vast forest and a flowing river, there is almost no 
limit to what can be built when it comes to homes, and defenses. As a citizen on Neplesha you can always 
be confident in the security of your village due to the powerful military which defends your lifestyle.
This is one of the many important things that the survival of our citizens depends on. 
The basis of the nepleshian society is based on military. With our strong military we are able to keep our citizens safe and defend our borders. 
We are also able to have our military enforce our laws and make sure people are safe and happy, and because our citizens have weapons they can assist our military in times of war, this also helps prevent government oppression. And along with the support they provide within the city, the success of conquests are almost always imminent. And with each military conquest that is  Earned the morale of our citizens rises higher and higher.
