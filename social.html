<h1> Social Aspect of Neplesha</h1>
<p> The most important part of this aspect is the equality between the citizens of 
this small but powerful society. And the social classes are completely fair between 
the many different classes. The classes we have are listed below.


<p>King</p>

 <p> Rules over all the people. Can make laws but the council must approve of it first before the law can be passed. 
 to prevent the rise of a tyrant. 
 And the council can propose laws to the king who must approve their laws as well. This helps keep a good balance in power in order 
 <p>Council</p>

 <p>The council does not rule over the people but it can propose laws to the king who must approve of the proposed law in order 
 for it to pass. All the people can be voted into the council giving everyone a fair oppertunity
 instead of just the higher classess. With everyone treated fairly, there is little reason for an uprising.</p>
 
 <p>Warriors</p>

 <p>Help protect the citizens of Neplesha. Consists of Archers and Swordsmen who are highly trained. The warriors are close handed fighters
 while the archers pick off intruders one by one from atop the archer towers mounted on the wall around the town.</p>
 
<p>Rich</p>

<p>The wealthy people of the city. Though they are rich, they do not avoid paying taxes. Instead the people 
are taxed fairly based on their income. </p>

<p>Middle Class</p>

<p>The middle class is made up of those who aren't very rich and also aren't very poor. Instead they have a 
balanced amount of money putting them inbetween the rich and poor. 

<p>Poor & Conquered Foes</p>

<p>This clas is made up of foreigners who have been conquered by Neplesha and of the poor 
citizens of the town. Once they join the town, they join the class that reflects how much money
they own. 

<p>Dishonored</p>
These are the people who have angered the king and therefore have had some of their rights taken away. 
And example is their ability to be voted into the council or any other important place in office. 
But even though they are dishonored they still have the right to vote.
