<h1>Political Aspect of Neplehsa</h1>
<p>Although the people are organized into the Rich, Middle, and Low classes, the government
gives each of them equal oppertunities in this town such as the poor citizens being able 
to set up markets and sell stuff to make money. This shows that the government doesn't only only favor the 
Rich class over the other classes. And the poor aren't kept from rising to higher classes because each citizens
of every class is taxed based on their income which can be gained after the completion of education.
